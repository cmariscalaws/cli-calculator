# 📈 Compound Interest Calculator (Python Training Project)

A Python-based **Compound Interest Calculator** built with **FastAPI** and modern development tooling.  
This project is designed for training purposes and demonstrates best practices in Python development with **Docker**, **FastAPI**, **Pydantic**, **PyTest**, and static analysis tools.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- **REST API** using FastAPI
- **Compound Interest Calculator**:
  - Future Value (FV) given principal, rate, compounding periods, and time
  - Required Interest Rate (R) given FV, principal, compounding periods, and time
- **Validated Inputs** with Pydantic
- **Tests** using PyTest
- **Static Analysis & Formatting**:
  - [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting
  - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
  - [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking
- **Containerized** with Docker
- **Built with [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** as Python package manager / builder
- **Future CI/CD Integration** with Bazel

## 📚 Compound Interest Formulas

### 1. **Future Value (FV)**  

`FV = P * (1 + R/N) ** (N * T)`

- `P`: Principal amount  
- `R`: Annual interest rate (decimal, e.g., 0.0412 for 4.12%)  
- `N`: Compounding periods per year  
- `T`: Total time in years  

**Example Test Case**  

- Input: `P=10000, R=0.0412, N=4, T=10`  

- Output: `FV ≈ 15000`  

### 2. **Required Interest Rate (R)**  

Rearranging the formula:  
`FV = P * (1 + R/N) ** (N * T)`
Solve for `R`.  

**Example Test Case**  

- Input: `FV=15000, P=10000, N=4, T=10`  
- Output: `R ≈ 0.0412 (≈ 4.12%)`
